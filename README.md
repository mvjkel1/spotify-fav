## Current status

This project is currently in its early development stages, and the README is being actively updated. I will continue to refine and expand it as the project evolves.

### Overview

The project target is to serve as a personal tool to monitor Spotify listening habits.

It will track the number of times you have listened to a track in a given timespan (e.g. in a week), and based on that it will be possible produce a playlist with the *most* listened tracks.

### Features (In progress)

- API with few endpoints, initially to work with tracks and playlists.
