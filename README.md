## Current status

This project is in the initial development phase, so the README is a work in progress. Updates will be made as development continues.

### Overview

The project target is to serve as a personal tool to monitor Spotify listening habits.

It will track the number of times you have listened to a track in a given timespan (e.g. in a week), and based on that it will produce a custom playlist with the most listened tracks.

### Features
