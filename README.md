# spotify-fav

_For those who (really) don't like the Spotify "next song" algorithm_

## Overview

**_spotify-fav_** is an API designed to track your listening habits on Spotify.

It is capable of monitoring how often you've played a certain track on Spotify and help you create playlists based on songs you haven't skipped. A song is considered `played` if it has been listened to for at least 10 seconds and `not skipped` if it's still playing with 10 seconds or less remaining when the system polls the current playback state.

[CURRENTLY OFF] Its "demo" version is already deployed at [CURRENTLY OFF]:

> [!IMPORTANT]

> At the current state, the API is deployed in the `Development mode`, so it wouldn't work for everyone.
Spotify allows me to add certain users which could use the API until I ask them for a review to make it official (accessible for everyone).
At the moment I am working on expanding its functionality, documenting and testing it as thoroughly as possible.
However, if youâ€™d like to use the API before its official release, it works perfectly on localhost. See the guide below for setup instructions.

## Features

- RESTful API with few endpoints documented using Swagger. Its mainly features are:
  - Tracking the number of times a song is fully listened to
  - Generating playlists based on your listening behavior (tracks you haven't skipped)
  - Displaying Spotify personal data (tracks, playlists, etc.)

## Technology Stack

This project leverages the following key technologies:

- **FastAPI**: For building API endpoints
- **SQLAlchemy**: To interact with the database
- **httpx**: For communicating with Spotify's API
- **Alembic**: For managing database migrations efficiently
- **pytest**: For writing and running unit and integration tests
- **Redis**: For caching purposes

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Spotify Developer Account (for API credentials)
- PostgresSQL database
- Redis database

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Create and activate the Python virtual environment
- Install all packages mentioned in requirements.txt by running

`pip install -r <path_to_requirements.txt>`

- Modify the .env_example file (stored in spotify-fav/src/server) to match your Spotify API and DB credentials

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> I have been using the PostgresDB platform provided by the https://neon.tech/.
> The Redis database that I have used is running on https://upstash.com/.

- Rename the .env_example to .env
- Run alembic migrations
  - Run the `alembic init alembic` command inside `./spotify-fav/src/server` directory to initialize alembic migrations
  - Modify the alembic.ini configuration file - provide the sqlalchemy.url
  - Modify the env.py file inside the alembic directory

```python
from app.db.models import Base
.
.
# add your model's MetaData object here
# for 'autogenerate' support
# from myapp import mymodel
# target_metadata = mymodel.Base.metadata
target_metadata = Base.metadata
```

- Run the migrations:

  - `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<your_msg>"`
  - `alembic upgrade heads`

- Execute the `run.sh` script, e.g. `./run.sh server`
- Open the browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- To access the core API routes, you need to register first, to do so:
  - Execute the /user-auth/register route to make an account, (the e-mail is not relevant at the moment, so you could use anything you like as long it is in the e-mail form)
  - Look for the [ðŸ”’] padlock icon in the Swagger UI to authorize API requests
  - Execute the /spotify-auth/login route to generate your unique Spotify login URL
  - Authenticate Spotify - copy the URL and paste it into your browser. Enter your Spotify credentials to log in
  - After successful login you should be redirected back to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Have fun
